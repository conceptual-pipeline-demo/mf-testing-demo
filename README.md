First doc about how to setup mainframe emulator on Macbook:
[MAINFRAME_SETUP_OLD](./doc/MAINFRAME_SETUP_OLD.md)
[MAINFRAME_SETUP_NEW](./doc/MAINFRAME_SETUP_NEW.md)

After environment is ready, can run the python script using `py3270` to automate the `TESTCOB` job

```shell
cd src
python screen_scraper.py
```
